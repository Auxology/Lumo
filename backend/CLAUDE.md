 ## Project Context

  Always read `PROJECT_INDEX.md`/PROJECT_INDEX.json first before exploring the codebase. It contains:
  - Project structure and architecture
  - Entry points for all services
  - Domain models and their locations
  - Key patterns (Outcome, CQRS, FastEndpoints)

  ## Quick Reference

  - Auth commands: `src/Auth/Auth.Application/Commands/`
  - Main commands: `src/Main/Main.Application/Commands/`
  - Domain aggregates: `*/Domain/Aggregates/*.cs`
